# Neural Networks
This is a Obsidian.md Vault about Neural Networks and how to build them.
It is split up into subtopics which are all explained in detail to understand how a Neural Network works from Scratch

Parts of the Neural Network that are included:
- Matrix math
- Forward Propagation
- Backward Propagation
- Optimization
- Gradient Descent
- Activation Functions and their derivatives
- Loss
- Preprocessing like:
	- Hyperparameter
	- Normalization
	- Parameter Initialization
- Validation
